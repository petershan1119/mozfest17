  - https://openedcaptions.com/
  - https://pietropassarelli.gitbooks.io/textav/projects/opened-captions-service.html


---
<img style="height:155px" src="https://archive.org/download/third-eye/third-eye.png"/>
- OCR 'lower third'
  - chyrons
    - overlaid text on broadcasts
    - not captions or descriptive text
    - editorial / summarizing in nature
- 4 TV channels, 24x7, ~1 min from realtime
  - CNN
  - MSNBC
  - Fox News
  - BBC News

# API
- Tab Separated Values
- https://archive.org/services/third-eye.php
  - nice for command-line
  - import to google and excel spreadsheets
  - filtered
  - raw (~25MB / day)
    - more errors
    - 3rd-party filtering possible
  - TSV files uploaded to https://archive.org/details/third-eye

---
# Chyron filtering
- tesseract OCR
  - free; errors
- simhash
  - groups 'nearly the same'
    - character flips
    - word off in time
- look for vowels
- pick 'most seen' group every minute
  - and tweet

---
# TV AI Examples
- Vox determined Puerto Rico was paid little attention by Fox News
  - https://vox.com/2017/10/2/16401614/fox-news-puerto-rico-charts
- audio fingerprints
  - presented keynote paper on CSPAN floor speeches and vocal pitch (UIowa)
  - discovered 375K political Ads
  - find sound bites of speeches
- Faceomatic - find appearances of US Govt officials in TV (facial recognition)

---
# Where We're Going
- https://archive.org/details/TVNewsKitchen
- want to serve journalists, researchers, librarians & more
- responsible behavior and access to data
- non-consumptive use


xxx
We can store and search arbitrary metadata (eg: <detected-person>..) as a JSON "clip" with start/end time ranges; can track play counts, referers/embeders.
HELP US shape our API to play with TV, tag clips with metadata or pointers to Decentralized metadata, AI ideas, and more!


xxx
audio fingerprinting (Duplitron)
face detection and tracking of public figures (Faceomatic)
TV clip-based JSON format metadata
# [part 2] "There Goes 2 Weeks -- deep dive into image matching and facial recognition"
  - slide on Rik & ideas w/ link to Decentralized talk
  - 3 concat vectors for shot clustering and scene detection
    - .. for Ad insertion!
- pixel diff algorithms
- perceptual hashing
  - show full => 8x8 grayscale faces xxx
    - explain _then_ convolved (?) to 64bit number
      - that hamming distance can be used on pairs

---
# TensorFlow & Training
- https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_recognition
- trained CNNs, locally run
- GoogLeNet Inception general classifier
- retrainable / customizable
  - redo 'top layer'
  - https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_retraining
- 2048 multi-byte vectors
- iOS smaller single-byte vectors
- cosine distance comparisons

---
# OpenFace
- implementation of FaceNet https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832
- https://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/demo-3-classifier
- similar to tensorflow (Torch..)

---
# OpenFace Training
- 3+ images per person/face
- avoid 'overfit'
- align eyes + nose (nostrils?)

# IA TV as reference news archive
- recording ~60 channels 24x7 since 2000
- 2m+ US news shows
- special collection subsets (trump and admin, US congress)
- for validation of nontampering:
  - we keep the original broadcast version (alongside web-friendly video)
  - we keep checksums and logs/provenance
  - absolute browser Privacy (client IP addresses one-way hashed)

- caption & metadata based searching
- chyron scanning OCR (editorial content?)
- facial detection
- caption correction & alignment
- popcorn editing & mashups of clips
  - https://archive.org/pop
  - https://github.com/mozilla/popcorn-editor

- twitter & slack bots, JSON/TSV API & access

---
# clips
- associates metadata with program start/end time range
- little JSON annotations
- arbitrary start/end
- auto expands each clip to a "synthetic" document
  - to elastic search
- JSONPatch for changes
- track play counts, some referers
- allows for _decentralized_ annotations to other IA / research

---
# clip
```json
{
    "268.1|269.1": {
        "subject": [
            "Criminal Activity"
            "Crime"
        ],
