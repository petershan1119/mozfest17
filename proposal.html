# TV Archives cracked open - "AI for IA"
### Artificial Intelligence for Internet Archive

Submitted to:

- Privacy & Security (Brett Gaylor)

### What will happen in your session?
archive.org/tv has been recording 60+ worldwide channels, 24x7, since 2000.
We have 2M+ news shows, including new Trump and Congress subsets, as citable reference, for captions/metadata search, AI experiments, Popcorn editing, and more.
Absolute browser Privacy - no personal data or IP addresses extracted.
For nontampering validation, we keep original versions with checksums and logs.
Recent AI: chyron ("lower third") scanning OCR; public officials facial detection; caption correction & alignment; twitter and slack bots with results.
We can store and search arbitrary metadata (eg: <detected-person>..) as a JSON "clip" with start/end time ranges; can track play counts, referers/embeders.
HELP US shape our API to play with TV, tag clips with metadata or pointers to Decentralized metadata, AI ideas, and more!

### What is the goal or outcome of your session?
To work with journalists, researchers, hackers, audio/video and captions and artificial intelligence folks, to learn more about what's available at archive.org/tv and help us extend it with API ideas and experiments.  We can show what feeds (examples: continuous captions feed from CSPAN; latest headlines shown on CNN, MSNBC, FOXNEWS, BBCNEWS TV shows) can be used now and are planned to be live soon.
We want to aid journalists and others with various ways to get summaries of what is going on in TV, since it is such a big, nonstop 'firehose' of content.
A secondary goal is to find ideas or requests we don't anticipate!
We anticipate making available many continuous feeds of AI results for all to use.

### After the festival, how will you and your participants take the learning and activities forward?
We anticipate people will start using some of our feeds and start finding interesting patterns or make interesting research and experiments.  We imagine many useful ideas will emerge at and after the festival and look forward to connecting with more groups using artificial intelligence in some way -- some we hope will provide us with new artificial intelligence and feeds.  We hope more organizations will start incorporating our feeds into their research and make their jobs easier.  We will setup a slack channel for future discussion and capture ideas and collaborations.  Our TV Archive is "at your service" -- we are here to help our participants and users!

### How will you deal with varying numbers of participants in your session? What if 30 participants attend? What if there are 3?
Any number should be pretty straightforward for the informational pieces.  When we get to brainstorming and discussion of AI and API ideas, for 10+ people, we'll split into smaller groups of approximate interest (roughly 5 per group) to help think of ideas together.  If we have some interested hands-on folks we can make a group that can tap into some of our feeds and play around with some ideas (if nothing else to get real-world experience with the feeds).  At the end we'll have people (or representatives if grouped) summarize their findings and thoughts to the overall group.
